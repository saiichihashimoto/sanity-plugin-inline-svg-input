## Installation

```sh
npm install @focus-reactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input
```

```sh
yarn add @focus-reactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input
```

```sh
pnpm add @focus-reactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input
```

## Usage

1. Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'sanity'
import { inlineSvgInput } from '@focus-reactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [inlineSvgInput()],
})
```

2. Use the `inlineSvg` type in your schema types:

```ts
// ...
{
  fields: [
    // ...
    {
      name: 'svgIcon',
      title: 'SVG Icon',
      type: 'inlineSvg',
    },
  ]
}
```

That's it! Now you can use this field to upload SVG images and see the preview in your Sanity Studio.

---

If you use [`@sanity-typed`](https://github.com/saiichihashimoto/sanity-typed/tree/main/packages/types#sanity-typedtypes), import `inlineSvgInputTyped` instead to get the correct types in your documents:

```js
import { defineType } from '@sanity-typed/types'
import { inlineSvgInputTyped } from '@focus-reactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [inlineSvgInputTyped()],
})
```

## Preview

The sections below describe how to preview your SVG within arrays, objects or your own custom preview component.

### Within arrays

Sanity offers a convenient way to preview arrays out of the box, but it only allows the use of the `image` type in `media`.
To provide same functionality for SVGs, we provide a ready-to-use preview component that mimics the default array preview.

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/focusreactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input/main/docs/preview-list.jpg)

To preview your SVG in arrays, use the `InlineSvgPreviewItem` component.\
It accepts the following props:

- `icon` [string] - inline SVG
- `title` [string] - the title of the item
- `subtitle` [string] - the subtitle of the item

`iconsList` in the example below is an array of objects with `icon`, `title` and `subtitle` fields.
To use them in preview the same way as the default array preview,
only what you need is to replace default preview component with `InlineSvgPreviewItem`.

```tsx
import { defineType } from 'sanity'
import { InlineSvgPreviewItem } from '@focus-reactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input'

const IconsListItem = defineType({
  type: 'object',
  name: 'iconsListItem',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'icon',
      type: 'inlineSvg',
    },
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'string',
    },
    {
      name: 'subtitle',
      type: 'string',
    },
  ],
  preview: {
    select: {
      icon: 'icon',
      title: 'title',
      subtitle: 'subtitle',
    },
  },
  components: {
    preview: ({ icon, title, subtitle }) => {
      return <InlineSvgPreviewItem icon={icon} title={title} subtitle={subtitle} />
    },
  },
})

const IconsList = defineType({
  name: 'iconsList',
  type: 'array',
  of: [{ type: IconsListItem.name }],
})
```

### Custom preview component

If you need more customization or want to build your own preview component using SVG icons,
you can use the `InlineSvgPreviewComponent`.

`InlineSvgPreviewComponent` is the smallest building block of the plugin the only purpose of which is to sanitize and render SVG.\
It accepts the following props:

- `value` [string] - inline SVG

```tsx
import { InlineSvgPreviewComponent } from '@focus-reactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input'

export const PreviewComponent = ({ value }) => {
  return (
    // ...
    <InlineSvgPreviewComponent value={value} />
    // ...
  )
}
```

To customize the preview component, you can either:

- Pass `className` or `style` props
- Extend default styles with `styled-components`

```tsx
import { InlineSvgPreviewComponent } from '@focus-reactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const StyledInlineSvg = styled(InlineSvgPreviewComponent)`
  // ...
`
```

## Development, testing and publishing

This plugin uses [@sanity/plugin-kit](https://github.com/sanity-io/plugin-kit)
with default configuration for build & watch scripts.

`npm run build` - creates a ready to publish plugin in `/dist` folder.

`npm run link-watch` - creates a symlink from the plugin repo to the local sanity repo and watches for changes.
After running this command, you will see the instructions on how to add this plugin to your Sanity Studio in the terminal.

`npm publish` - there is pre-publish script that prepares the plugin for publishing, you don't need to build it manually.
Please run `npm publish --dry-run` to make sure that everything is ok before publishing.

See [Testing a plugin in Sanity Studio](https://github.com/sanity-io/plugin-kit#testing-a-plugin-in-sanity-studio)
